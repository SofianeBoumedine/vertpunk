# VERTPUNK

Vertpunk is a fork of [Coinpunk](https://coinpunk.com/) modified for use on the [Vertcoin](http://vertcoin.org) network.

## NOTE!

This branch is for tracking changes to the public Vertpunk wallet service at [wallet.coinme.ca](https://wallet.coinme.ca). This version has been heavily customized for this specific site. You are probably better off using [this branch](https://github.com/dayreiner/vertpunk/tree/vertpunk-0.3.7-dev) instead for your own deployments.
